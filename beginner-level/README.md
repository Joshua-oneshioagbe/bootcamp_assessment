My decision to transition into cloud engineering stems from my long-term career aspirations. I’ve come to realize that having a first degree in Computer Engineering alone isn’t enough to equip me with all the tools I need to become the person I aspire to be. This journey is about aligning planning and preparation with opportunity—one I am determined not to miss.

If given the opportunity to join the bootcamp I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals, people genuinely driven to build systems that enable them to create a promising future without resorting to crime or other vices. I am looking forward to interacting with cloud solutions like AWS and Azure and whatever provisions are made during the bootcamp. I am confident that being part of the Bootcamp will provide the knowledge, skills, and experience I need to pursue my resolve to pursue a career in Cloud engineering.
